Mcts_modified.py contains the heuristic bot which can be pit against two basic bots (random_bot.py and rollout_bot.py) or 
mcts_vanilla.py, which is the same as the modified version except without the heuristic algorithm.

Experiment2.txt lists the results between the modified and vanilla versions.

All tests were run through the command prompt console.
